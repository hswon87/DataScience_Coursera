## Overview

This assignment is to create a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. 
I plot a scatterplot with mtcars dataset
```{r, echo=FALSE}
suppressMessages(library(plotly))
```

## Scatterplot
```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot_ly(data = mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, type = "scatter", color = ~as.factor(cyl))
```
